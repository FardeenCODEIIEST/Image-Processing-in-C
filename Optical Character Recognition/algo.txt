Vertical scan Algorithm
-----------------------------------------
for each row
  for each column
    pointer=1
    move upward from unvisited base-line pixel
    if(pixel is white)

      then mark that pixel visited
      pointer=pointer+1
    
    else look at Right pixel
    
    if(Right Pixel is White)

      then move right and goto Step 6
    
    else if (pointer>=MedianHeight)
      
      pseudo-pointer=pointer
      offset=[1,2,3]
      if(pixel at (pseudo-pointer+ number in offset) is White)

        then do not make cut; goto baseline and continue Step 6

      else
      
       then make a vertical blank region(Segmentation)
end
